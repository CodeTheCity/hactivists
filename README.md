Wireshark is a network packet analyzer tool that allows us to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. While Wireshark can help you identify network security vulnerabilities, it is not a tool for securing user credentials.
By Using wireshark we can track what is the source and destination sources, 
whether the user details are visible or not, 
To secure user credentials using Wireshark, we can use these steps:
1. Encourage users to use strong passwords and enforce password policies that require users to change their passwords periodically.
2. The user  needs to encrypt the credentials before transmitting them over to the network. Use protocols such as HTTPS, SSL, or TLS to secure the data.
3. By Using Wireshark we can monitor the network traffic to identify any unauthorized access or suspicious activity. We can even configure Wireshark to capture packets containing specific keywords, such as login or password, to identify potential security breaches.
4. Data transferred through http and ftp packets are not encrypted so, it's very easy for malicious hackers to steal credentials such as login credentials.
5. Implementing two-factor authentication so that the user will be provided with an extra layer of security. This will require users to provide two forms of identification before they can access their accounts.
6. Limit access to sensitive information to only authorized personnel. Use firewalls and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your network.
Wireshark can be used to monitor network traffic for potential security breaches, but it is not a tool for securing user credentials. To secure user credentials, you should use encryption, strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and limit access to sensitive information.
